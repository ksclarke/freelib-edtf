freelib-edtf (version 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT)   https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-edtf


================================================================================
  INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This is a Java library for working with dates, times, etc. that conform to the
Extended Date Time Format (EDTF) standard (still in draft status).  It's still
in an early stage of development, so probably isn't of much use yet.  I'll add
more documentation once it's in a more stable/useful state.
